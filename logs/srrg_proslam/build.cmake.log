CMake Warning (dev) at src/EC-PGO/CMakeLists.txt:62 (target_link_libraries):
  Policy CMP0023 is not set: Plain and keyword target_link_libraries

  The plain signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "EC_PGO".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target
  should be either all-keyword or all-plain.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
